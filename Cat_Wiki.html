            The <strong>cat</strong> (<em>Felis catus</em>) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.<sup>[1][2] </sup>
            It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to 
            as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
            [4]. <br>

            A cat can either be a <strong>house cat</strong> , a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely
            and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their 
            ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries
